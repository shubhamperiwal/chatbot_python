There are great walks or short bike rides around the local waterways.   BEACHES: We are less than 2 miles from the beach. A short bike ride in the summer will help you avoid the hassle of parking.","Our home is solar-powered. The guesthouse has fans but no air conditioning. The room is cleaned between every visit, but nothing is new. If you expect new and shiny, this place is not for you. The price varies from season to season and from day to day based upon availability and demand.  We do discount the price if the room remains unbooked, so there are some great last day deals. The price you pay is what Airbnb says you will pay AFTER you have correctly identified the dates, the number of guests and pets.  The price for a one-night stay is never less than $50 because $40 is our cleaning fee and the nightly fee is never less than $10.  Sometimes, Airbnb advertises our guesthouse without the cleaning fee.  Thus, Airbnb's advertised price can be as low as $10/night (even though the true cost for a single night's stay at this price will be $50).  We understand that this can be misleading, but we don't control how Airbnb advertises prices.","LOCATION:  Airbnb provides the location on its maps. Click on maps above the photos. We are in Long Beach about a 30-minute drive from LAX, Downtown L.A., or Disneyland, all of which are in different directions from here. You can find us by doing a map search online for ""7th and PCH 90814, USA"" Many of our guests use this as a base to visit L.A., Disneyland (20 miles), Universal Studios (40 miles), Santa Monica (36 miles), Laguna Beach (31 miles) and all other Southern California attractions. We also highly recommend checking out the local shopping and beaches. We are a bike ride away from the Long Beach Aquarium and the Queen Mary. This is a fabulous place to visit.   Cal State Long Beach is walking distance and Long Beach Convention Center is 4.5 miles.  VISITING L.A.: If this is your first visit to Southern California and you intend to travel to see the sights, you should know that the Los Angeles area is spread out and it is very useful to have a car.  A popular day-trip for our gu","BOOKING A ROOM:  We welcome all happy guests including people who have used Airbnb for all their vacations and people who are new to Airbnb.  We prefer it you give us a two or three sentence description of who you are, the age and relationship of all the guests your are bringing with you , and why you are coming to Long Beach when you book.  We don't have a minimum stay but we reserve the right to reject a booking if you are only going to stay one or two nights leaving us with one or two single nights unbooked. WE ONLY WANT GUESTS WHO WILL BE HAPPY AND GIVE US A FIVE STAR REVIEW.  If after reading our description and a few reviews, you are not certain that this is your version of five star accommodation, please book elsewhere.  Our guesthouse is not new.  If you are looking for new, spacious and modern (rather than charming, quaint, comfortable and inexpensive), this place is not for you.   We don't guarantee that the room will be cleaned until after 4pm on the day of arrival.  Otherwi","We are a friendly bunch and will interact with you if you are interested in interacting with us.  However, we understand that some guests are here just to get away and spend time with each other so the amount of interaction will depend upon you.  If you feel you are not getting the interaction you would like (either too much or too little), please let us know.   Please use the message board to communicate with us both before and after you book your stay.  Several of us monitor the message board.  The message board works better than texts, emails or phone calls, because we can identify who you are and when you are staying with us.","No smoking of any kind in the room or within 10 feet of the door.  Be respectful, and polite. Understand that you are renting a guesthouse that is part of our home.  We are usually happy to assist you if you are gracious and appreciative, but running the guesthouse is not our primary occupation.    We only want people who are excited to be here and who will give us 5-star reviews.  If you are not sure whether this place if for you, read the reviews.  If you are still not sure, it is probably not for you.  Most people love this place, but it is not for everyone. Tips for getting a good review from us:  If you want something from us, let us know.  Don't wait till the end of your trip and then complain about it.  Be appreciative.

(URL HIDDEN) LOCAL POINTS OF INTEREST: AirBnB does a great job of covering Topanga!  Check out their location guide here: https://www.airbnb.com/locations/los-angeles/topanga Topanga State Beach is an 8 minute drive & Topanga State Park is about a 5 minute drive.  In Topanga, there are many hiking trails, some with eight thousand year-old Indian caves & waterfalls.    Mimosa Cafe is the village coffee shop, which is a 10 minute hike down the hill.  Just across the way from Mimosa, there is a natural foods store & a little mini market.  Santa Monica & Malibu are a beautiful 15 minute drive along Pacific Coast Highway.   Suggested local restaurants would be Inn of the Seventh Ray, Froggy's & Cholada Thai food.  Great restaurants in Malibu are Geoffrey's, Nobu Sushi & Cafe Habana. The closest large grocery store is a Von's Market, located on Sunset Blvd.  There's also a natural foods market & deli in Malibu, named PC Greens. A","QUIET HOURS: My property has a quiet period from 10 pm to 8 am, and I do turn off outdoor lighting at 10 pm.   This allows guests & tenants to sleep soundly & keeps noise to a minimum.  As noise travels in the canyon, I do like to be respectful & request that guests keep quiet during those hours. LIGHTING AT NIGHT:  Please note that my property has lighting similar to as shown in photos, but that the photos were taken on a time lapse to better display the night lighting.  Time lapse is the only technique a photographer can use to show off the lighting, but the lighting may appear slightly different in person.    TOPANGA WILDLIFE: As Topanga is rural, I request that guests be aware & keep tidy while staying at the guest house by cleaning up garbage, wiping up food crumbs & keeping dishes clean & bring dishes inside as soon as finished if dining outdoors.  This helps me prevent raccoons from getting into dishes that are left outdoors, and to control ants or flies.  I do have the occasion","PUBLIC TRANSIT: there is no public transit in Topanga Canyon -- you will need a car!  The closest public transit is the MTA line 534, which runs along Pacific Coast Highway.","AMENITIES: BRAND NEW TIPI on property!  For hanging out & lounging! Also featuring: outdoor bathtub, indoor stone shower, wireless internet, satellite television, HD flat screen TV with DVD player,  DVD library, microwave, toaster oven, stove top, mini fridge, kitchen with coffee maker/filters/tea, dishes & pots & pans, towels, shampoo & body wash, hot tub with crystal fireplace, year-round springs & waterfalls, filtered water, tropical gardens surrounding guest house, large decks & patios, great views,  outdoor bed for napping, hammocks, 1 car carport parking, & more.","VISITORS while STAYING: As the property is shared with other guests & sound carries in the canyon, I want to maintain an atmosphere of privacy & tranquility.  Therefore, I do not allow visitors during your stay.  The guesthouse is reserved for 2 people that I meet during check in.    PRIVACY: The guesthouse is a stand-alone unit, private & faces a large lawn with firepit (as shown in the photos).  I do have a gardener, you may get a glimpse of and/or myself maintaining grounds. The hot tub is reserved for your use, from 10 am to 10 pm (other tenants have their own hot tub).  I live on the property, remotely & away from view of the guesthouse, but am reachable by phone call.  Many couples stay at my property for romantic getaways & aside from check in, I sometimes I do not see them for the entire weekend/they do not see anyone, unless they call on me for assistance. All amenities including lawn & hot tub are reserved for AirBnB Guests during listed hours;  but know that you may see an o","Two adult guests per guest house maximum (no children of any age allowed,  this also means no infants) -- NO SMOKING OF ANY KIND anywhere on property, due to fire hazards/tenant concerns, no pets, no self check ins, no visitors. NO SELF CHECK INS, you must contact & coordinate with me for a property tour! For Cancellations, please refer to my listing page for my cancellation policy. For rebooking, I require a 2 week minimum window for rebooking; exceptions on rebooking window available for life threatening emergencies with exception available upon show of documentation.  Due to my property size, I am unable to host events.  Do know that if I catch guests breaking any of my rules, I will contact AirBnB immediately & the reservation will be cancelled.  No visitors are allowed during your stay, due to keeping my property a private tranquil place for other guests. If I catch a guest trying to throw a party or sneaking people onto my property, I will contact AirBnB & cancel the reservation ",,,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/21303889/bf80a075_original.jpg?aki_policy=large,,2258135,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/2258135,Darrell,2012-04-30,"Topanga, California, United States","Hey, 

I'm Darrell -- native to California, I own an antique & vintage clothing store in Topanga Canyon.   I enjoy spending time surfing, spear fishing, diving, snorkeling, traveling, storytelling & generally spending time outdoors.  I also enjoy a good movie -- my favorite is the Indiana Jones trilogy & Avatar. 

I've lived in Topanga Canyon since the 70s & have spent many years creating an environment where I want to spend as much time as possible.  I love visiting any place tropical & wanted to live in Hawaii, but decided to create my own tropical escape here.  My place is like a combination of the Swiss Family Robinson & the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland.

I enjoy meeting people from all over & I often host small BBQs with my tenants who also live on the property.    I'm an easy going host & live in a treehouse on site, so I'm available if you need anything!   If you'd like to share a meal or hang out around the fire, I always enjoy hearing stories from new people.

My name is Carlos Roberto Sanchez-Rosas, my friends call me ""Sano"" (It means healthy in Spanish)  I have been a host in the Airbnb community for 5 years. It has been amazing and highly rewarding with great memories and awesome new friends.

Sigmund Freud stated, ""The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind."" And because in LA is the sunny place where we are all kings, I aim to give every single guest at Casa de Carlos the royal treatment when they choose to stay here.  

I always take joy and satisfaction been a host. I believe we have become ambassadors because we proudly introduce visitors to our beloved city. I wholeheartedly believe that is great public service. There are lots of ways we are contributing to the sharing economy and it is a really good fit with who we are as Angelenos. Our ultimate goal is to turn every visitor encounter into a positive, memorable experience.

We are looking forward to meet you.

No crimes in the area last I looked.  Its located in a unique little corner of coastal San Pedro called Point Fermin. You'll notice, driving down Pacific, how it changes from the downtown area to the beachy end town. Tons of movies and tv shows are filmed in the area.

In the mid-afternoons, when the wind picks up, you can see wind surfers in the Cabrillo Beach cove, outside the front windows. Dolphin sitings are common.

Nice too meet you, my name is Patrick Lennon and I was born and raised in Venice Beach, CA, part of one of the largest families in L.A., the Lennons.  Our family has been populating Venice since 1904, so you won't find a more local family.  I own and operate three companies, D2 Models, a nationwide modeling agency Klothwork, a distributor and retailer for sweatshirts and t-shirts and finally Book My Lot, an online resource for locating and booking food trucks around the country.  I ended up buying the house I grew up in located right in the heart of Venice and now live here with my beautiful wife Cristina.   We've decided to share it with world travelers and allow them to experience a big piece of Venice locality from location, to family, to food and entertainment.  We're extremely family oriented and have hundreds of friends and family around the neighborhood.  We love being social, just kickin' it on the couch with a good home cooked meal,  the company of others, travelling and meeting new people!  I worked in the restaurant industry before starting my companies so I have a great sense of what to see and what to do when in Venice for entertainment.  I work from home, am always here to help and because I am my own boss, I have the freedom to jump on a bike with my guests and show them around town.

Nice too meet you, my name is Patrick Lennon and I was born and raised in Venice Beach, CA, part of one of the largest families in L.A., the Lennons.  Our family has been populating Venice since 1904, so you won't find a more local family.  I own and operate three companies, D2 Models, a nationwide modeling agency Klothwork, a distributor and retailer for sweatshirts and t-shirts and finally Book My Lot, an online resource for locating and booking food trucks around the country.  I ended up buying the house I grew up in located right in the heart of Venice and now live here with my beautiful wife Cristina.   We've decided to share it with world travelers and allow them to experience a big piece of Venice locality from location, to family, to food and entertainment.  We're extremely family oriented and have hundreds of friends and family around the neighborhood.  We love being social, just kickin' it on the couch with a good home cooked meal,  the company of others, travelling and meeting new people!  I worked in the restaurant industry before starting my companies so I have a great sense of what to see and what to do when in Venice for entertainment.  I work from home, am always here to help and because I am my own boss, I have the freedom to jump on a bike with my guests and show them around town.   We promise you'll love the stay and would much rather it be affordable and fun then expensive and boring!",within an hour,100%,,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1182390/profile_pic/1397244885/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1182390/profile_pic/1397244885/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Venice,3.0,3.0,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba', 'work_email']",t,t,"Venice, CA, United States",Venice,Venice,,Venice,CA,90291,Los Angeles,"Venice, CA",US,United States,33.996359999999996,-118.4544,t,Guesthouse,Entire home/apt,4,1.0,1.0,2.0,Real Bed,"{TV,Internet,Wifi,Kitchen,""Free street parking"",Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",Keypad,""Pack ’n Play/travel crib"",""Hot water"",""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Full kitchen""}",,$95.00,,,$150.00,$35.00,2,$20.00,1,29,1,1,29,29,1.0,29.0,a week ago,t,7,13,27,237,2019-03-07,519,119,2014-05-29,2019-02-23,98.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,f,,"{""City of Los Angeles"","" CA""}",t,f,strict_14_with_grace_period,f,f,2,2,0,0,8.93
